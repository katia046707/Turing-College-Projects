# Turing-College-Projects
This repository showcases a multifaceted data analytics projects completed as part of a structured learning program at Turing College.
It integrates SQL-based data manipulations, Excel files, Power BI-based data visualizations, and in-depth data analysis methods.


üéØ Objective:
These projects simulate the role of a Product Analyst, focusing on actionable insights derived from real-world scenarios. 
The primary goal is to demonstrate competency in:

SQL Proficiency: 
Writing optimized queries for data extraction and transformation.

Power BI Visualization: 
Developing advanced dashboards for data storytelling.

Analytical Methods: 
Applying concepts like funnel analysis, cohort analysis, A/B testing, and KPI tracking.

üìÇ Repository Structure:
/SQL/: 
Contains SQL scripts for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
/PowerBI/: 
Includes Power BI files and exported visuals for the dashboard.
/Documentation/: 
Contains supporting documents, including the project explanations.

üõ† Projects Overview:
1. Problem Statement:
2. The projects focus on analyzing user interactions to optimize product performance, identify bottlenecks, and improve feature adoption.

Specific objectives include:
Performing funnel analysis to track user journeys.
Investigating KPIs and defining OKRs.
Conducting A/B tests for feature evaluations.
Segmenting users to derive actionable insights.

2. Data Sources:
The projects leverage user event data and operational logs. The data is modeled into structured tables for analysis.

3. Deliverables:

In-depth analysis results with actionable recommendations.


üñ•Ô∏è Power BI Dashboards and Advanced Excel files:
These projects include advanced Power BI dashboards and Excel presentations with the following features:

Funnel Analysis:
Tracks user engagement through various stages (e.g., view, add-to-cart, purchase).
Identifies drop-off points and improvement areas.

A/B Testing:
Compares user behavior across test and control groups.
Visualizes KPIs to validate hypothesis tests.

User Segmentation:
Provides insights into distinct user groups based on activity levels.
Highlights trends to target marketing and product development.

üìä SQL Scripts
Purpose :
The SQL scripts are crafted to:

Extract event data from relational databases.
Clean and preprocess raw data into structured formats.
Generate metrics for visualization and analysis.
Scripts Included
Data Extraction: Pulling user event logs and backend metrics.
Data Transformation: Aggregating data into funnel stages and user cohorts.
Data Validation: Ensuring data integrity and completeness.

Find all scripts in the /SQL/ directory.


üìö Learning Objectives
These projects demonstrate the application of key skills, including:

SQL & Database Management:
Writing efficient queries.
Handling relational and JSON data.

Power BI Dashboards:
